# Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to evaluate a potential investment in a surf n' shake shop. The investor had previously been a part of another shop that did not succeed due to the weather. With the data provided by W. Avy, this project analysed the weather patterns on the island of said shop. We looked specifically at the months of June and December to determine if the weather conditions are a risk to operating year round.

# Results

June Temperature Statistics

- The average temperature for June is 74.94 degrees.
- The minimum temperature for June is 64 degrees.
- The maximum temperature for June is 85 degrees.


 

December Temperature Statistics

- The averate temperature for December is 71 degrees.
- The minimum temperature for December is 56 degrees.
- The maximum temperature for December is 83 degrees.

 

# Summary

The average temperature between June and December only differs by roughly three degrees. The sample data was higher for the month of June than December but the standard deviation is very similar. The would  probably not influence the data that drastically. Given it is warmer in June, they could try to expand the ice cream side of the business during those hot months to help increae revenue. In December and the colder months, concentrate more on the wet suits that may be preferred during that colder season. 

Given that his previous investment was "rained out", a deeper look into the rain during these same two months might be helpful to visualize.
